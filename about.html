            <h3>Features of Good Design</h3>
            <li><p>Sustainable</p></li>
            <p>The problem with sustainable design is that it's easier to talk about than to do properly.</p>
            <li><p>Accessible</p></li>
            <p>What is good design if it only available to some. Here in the detailed codes dictate that our built environment be accessible to those with disabilities. Often times it is important to look  beyond these minimum standards.</p>
